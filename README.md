Introduction to Artificial Intelligence Using Python Programming Language

What is Artificial intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence is an attempt to make a computer, a robot, or other technology ‘think’ and process data in the same way as we humans do.
AI therefore has to study how the human brain ‘thinks’, learns, and makes decisions when it tries to solve problems or execute a task.
AI involves the development of computer systems that can perceive, reason, learn, and make decisions to mimic or augment human cognitive abilities.
AI is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans.
Artificial Intelligence is building intelligent machines from vast volumes of data.

Artificial intelligence today is properly known as narrow AI (or weak AI), in that it is designed to perform a narrow task such as only facial recognition, or only internet searches, or only driving a car). However, the long-term goal of many researchers is to create general AI (AGI or strong AI).
