## Introduction to Artificial Intelligence Using Python Programming Language

## What is Artificial intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence is an attempt to make a computer, a robot, or other technology ‘think’ and process data in the same way as we humans do.
AI therefore has to study how the human brain ‘thinks’, learns, and makes decisions when it tries to solve problems or execute a task.
AI involves the development of computer systems that can perceive, reason, learn, and make decisions to mimic or augment human cognitive abilities.
AI is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans.
Artificial Intelligence is building intelligent machines from vast volumes of data.

Artificial intelligence today is properly known as narrow AI (or weak AI), in that it is designed to perform a narrow task such as only facial recognition, or only internet searches, or only driving a car). However, the long-term goal of many researchers is to create general AI (AGI or strong AI).

Application of AI
Artificial Intelligence has various applications in today's society. It is becoming essential for today's time because it can solve complex problems efficiently in multiple industries, such as Healthcare, entertainment, finance, education, etc. AI is making our daily life more comfortable and fast.

Following are some sectors which have the application of Artificial Intelligence:

1. AI in Astronomy: <br>
Artificial Intelligence can be beneficial to solve complex universe problems. AI technology can help us understand the universe such as how it works, its origin, etc.
2. AI in Healthcare: <br>
In the last, five to ten years, AI has become more advantageous for the healthcare industry and is going to have a significant impact on this industry.
Healthcare Industries are applying AI to make a better and faster diagnosis than humans. AI can help doctors with diagnoses and can inform when patients are worsening so that medical help can reach the patient before hospitalization.
3. AI in Gaming:
AI can be used for gaming purposes. The AI machines can play strategic games like chess, where the machine needs to think of a large number of possible places.
4. AI in Finance:
AI and finance industries are the best matches for each other. The finance industry is implementing automation, chatbot, adaptive intelligence, algorithm trading, and machine learning into financial processes.
5. AI in Data Security:
The security of data is crucial for every company and cyber-attacks are growing very rapidly in the digital world. AI can be used to make your data more safe and secure. Some examples such as the AEG bot, and AI2 Platform, are used to determine software bugs and cyber-attacks in a better way.
6. AI in Social Media:
Social Media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat contain billions of user profiles, which need to be stored and managed in a very efficient way. AI can organize and manage massive amounts of data. AI can analyze lots of data to identify the latest trends, hashtags, and requirements of different users.
7. AI in Travel & Transport:
AI is becoming highly demanding for travel industries. AI is capable of doing various travel-related work such as making travel arrangements to suggesting hotels, flights, and the best routes to customers. Travel industries are using AI-powered chatbots which can make human-like interaction with customers for better and fast response.
8. AI in Automotive Industry:
Some Automotive industries are using AI to provide virtual assistant to their user for better performance. Such as Tesla has introduced TeslaBot, an intelligent virtual assistant.
Various Industries are currently working to develop self-driven cars that can make your journey more safe and secure.
9. AI in Robotics:
Artificial Intelligence has a remarkable role in Robotics. Usually, general robots are programmed such that they can perform some repetitive tasks, but with the help of AI, we can create intelligent robots that can perform tasks with their own experiences without pre-programmed.
Humanoid Robots are the best examples of AI in robotics, recently the Intelligent humanoid robot named Erica and Sophia has been developed which can talk and behave like humans.
10. AI in Entertainment:
We are currently using some AI-based applications in our daily lives with some entertainment services such as Netflix or Amazon. With the help of ML/AI algorithms, these services show the recommendations for programs or shows.
11. AI in Agriculture:
Agriculture is an area that requires various resources, labor, money, and time for the best result. Nowadays agriculture is becoming digital, and AI is emerging in this field. Agriculture is applying AI in agriculture robotics, solid and crop monitoring, and predictive analysis. AI in agriculture can be very helpful for farmers.
12. AI in E-commerce:
AI is providing a competitive edge to the e-commerce industry, and it is becoming more demanding in the e-commerce business. AI is helping shoppers discover associated products with recommended sizes, colors, or even brands.
13. AI in education:
AI can automate grading so that the tutor can have more time to teach. AI chatbot can communicate with students as a teaching assistant.
AI in the future can work as a personal virtual tutor for students, which will be accessible easily at any time and any place.
